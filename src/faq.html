Within 48 hours, you'll be contacted by one of our representatives, with whom you'll be able to discuss your needs and wishes. <br>
                    During the process of development, you may be contacted by our representative to give your opinion on certain matters. You are also encouraged to contact our representative if you require clarification for something. <br>
                    After the site itself is ready, some features like SEO might still need development, as they require collecting data over multiple months</p>

A static site may be shipped within 2 weeks, while a site with sophisticated back-end features that require testing and security patches may be under development for months.

                    <p class="answer-text paragraph light">Yes, you can. If you choose to do so, however, we will provide support and website hosting for only 3 months after the transaction, and domain renewal for only one year. Buying the website costs 8 months-worth of what your selected plan costs (e.g. If you chose the Value plan, which costs $x/month, buying the site will cost $8x). If you change your mind at any time after the transaction and wish to receive our service once again, you must void your rights over the source-code, assets and design. </p>
